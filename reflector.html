<h1> UDP Packet Reflector / Forwarder </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>This application operates in two modes:

<ul> 

<li><strong>packet reflector</strong> that sends UDP packets back
to the host that sent them.

<li><strong>packet forwarder</strong> that forwards packets between a
number of unicast UDP sources acting as bridge when multicast is not
available.

</ul> 

The reflector will also drop packets, duplicate packets, and add
jitter on a per port basis.  The default method of setting parameters
is through a tcl/tk user interface, but they can also be sent to the
application via TCP so they can be set by TELNET or alternate
interfaces.  This latter control method has been used in audio and
video perception experiments.

<p> This code came into existence to help for debugging of Mbone tools
when multicast is not available and for running loopback tests with
tunable jitter, delay, and duplication.

<p> The program does not support packet forwarding or reception from
multicast groups.

<h2> Availability </h2>

<p> The code is only available in source code form.  It comes with a
configure script that works on Solaris and FreeBSD and should work on
most UNIX variants with little modification.  Socrates Varakliotis has
made modifications to make it run on Win32 though I may never get
around to incorporating them.

<p> You can download the <a href="reflector.tar.gz">UNIX source
code</a>, <a href="win_refl2.zip">Win32 source code</a>, or you get
the latest source by <a href="http://www-mice.cs.ucl.ac.uk/multimedia/software/cvsanon.html">anonymous cvs</a>.

<h2> Command line arguments </h2>

<pre>
reflector [-f] [-n] [-c &#60;port&#62;] [-k &#60;known host1&#62;,&#60;known host2&#62;, ..] port1 port2
</pre>

<p>where:

<br>-f selects packet forwarder (bridging) mode.  By default it acts as a reflector.

<br>-n disables the user interface.

<br>-c enables a control channel on port &#60;port&#62;.

<br>-k creates a list of known hosts.  If packets are received from
other hosts they are discarded.  By default the application expands
the list of known hosts as they send packets.  The known hosts should
be comma separated with no spaces.

<br> The final arguments are a white space delimited list of ports.
Note the parameters in the user interface are tunable on a per port
basis. 

<h2> Remote control commands </h2>

There are three groups of commands: liveness testing (helo), parameter
setting, and parameter retrieving.  

<pre>helo</pre>

<pre>port &#60;port&#62; set &#60;loss|min_delay|max_delay|dup&#62 &#60;value&#62;</pre>

<pre>port &#60;port&#62; get &#60;loss|min_delay|max_delay|dup&#62 </pre>

<h2> Examples </h2>

Here are some simple examples using the UDP based audio conferencing
program RAT.  In the below examples RAT is started with a single port
argument but the reflector is started with two parts because RAT uses
RTP and RTP uses two ports: one for media data and one for reporting.

<h3> Packet reflector </h3>

A user on fred wants to debug RAT by reflecting packets off of fred.

<pre>
barney% reflector 10000 10001

fred% rat -allowloopback barney/10000

</pre>


<h3> Packet forwarder </h3>

There are three users who want to have a unicast conference using
machine barney as a bridge.  On each machine the arguments would be:

<pre>

barney% reflector -f -k fred,wilma,betty 10000 10001

fred%  rat barney/10000

wilma% rat barney/10000

betty% rat barney/10000

</pre>

<h3> Remote Control </h3>

A user on dibble wants to control the reflector on topcat which is
being used to add delay and loss for conferencing between benny and
goldie.  In this example TELNET is used, but it could be any
application.

<pre>
topcat% reflector -f -n -k benny,goldie -c 12345 10000 10001
benny%  rat topcat/10000
goldie% rat topcat/10000

dibble% telnet topcat 12345
Trying topcat...
Connected to topcat
Escape character is '^]'.
helo
helo
port 10000 set loss 5
ok
port 10000 get loss
5.00
</pre>
