User-Level Packet Reflector

To make
-------

To build this program type:
	./configure
	./make

This will build the binary and leave it in the source directory. 

Building assumes you have Tcl/Tk installed you may have to specify the
location of the Tcl/Tk installations with:

./configure --with-tcl=... --with-tk=...

This configure script has only been fitted to solaris and freebsd.

Sample Usage
------------

./reflector <port1> <port2> ...

All packets that are received on the specified ports are returned to
sender.  Through the graphical interface you can select the uniform
loss rate, the minimum and maximum delay applied to each packet.  The
resolution of the delay is usually 10ms.

and on the machine you want to run the audio tool type:

fudge% rat -allow_loopback toffee/10000
